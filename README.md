# System Design
The main design consideration is to reduce the traffic on the server as much as possible. This means that content that are network-intensive in nature (Game Updates, Voice Data) are offloaded to the clients, using Peer-To-Peer networking to achieve inter-client communication. This is to be implemented using the WebRTC protocol.

However, in view of the fact that updates still need to be sent to the server for storage in the database, the system will employ a Master-Slave architecture for the clients, with 1 distinct Master-client communicating with the server, and all other Slave-clients communicating solely with that single Master-client.

The high-level system design and network endpoints are summarised in the following diagram.

# Technologies
The following are the planned technologies that will be used to implement the various parts of the system.
